# QFS Tokenomics

We took one of our favourite coins, Sushiswap, and used it as the basis for our tokenomics. We made some alterations along the way to better suit our vision, keep things fresh and original, and improve the economics around the token.

**The tokenomics of QFS can be broken down in the following way:**

* At launch 30 QFS tokens will be minted per block.
* Every 2 months after that number of tokens minted per block is reduced by 2 tokens.
* Up to 100% of the exchange trade fees are awarded to holders in the form of QFS tokens.
* 50% of swap fees are reserved for a scheduled buyback of the QFS token for burning, and the remaining 50% go to development.

Our goal is to come up with the most fair and equal distribution of the token supply so that early holders are heavily rewarded, while at the same time creating strong incentives for long term growth, encouraging new investors to join our ecosystem.

**This is the breakdown of the QFS supply:**

* 350,000,000 → Total supply/hardcap
* 345,000,000 → Emissions 
  * Farms / Launchpools: 85.7% per block 
  * Referral Program: 4.3% per block 
  * Holders Insurance: 1% per block 
  * Team: 9% per block 
* 2,100,000 → Team tokens, locked and vested for 12 months
* 2,000,000 → Unlocked for marketing and partnerships
* 400,000 → Presale including referrals
* 400,000 → Initial liquidity
* 100,000 → Giveaways/Prizes

## **Our Deflationary Mechanics**

At present, QFS is also burned in the following ways:

* [x] **0.02%** of every trade made on QFSwap
* [x] **100%** of ****QFS raised in IDOs 
* [x] **50%** of QFS sent to team address
* [x] **3%** of every prediction markets round soon will be used to buy QFS for burning
* [x] **2%** of every yield harvest in the QFS Pool

**In creating the tokenomics for QFS we took inspiration from other successful AMMs we admire like Pancake and Uniswap and combined the best aspects of each one in order to create a highly optimised token that users will appreciate holding and using.**
