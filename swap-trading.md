# Swap/Trading

QFSwap Exchange is a fully automated market maker \(AMM\) that enables users to trade two Kucoin Community Chain tokens. 

The exchange's liquidity is provided by Liquidity Providers \("LPs"\) who invest their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user receives LP tokens, which can be staked in the "Farms" to earn QFS tokens. When a user conducts a token swap \(trade\) on the exchange, they will be charged a trading fee of 0.1 percent, which is calculated as follows: 0.05 percent is sent to liquidity providers as a fee, and 0.05 percent is utilized to burn QFS tokens.
