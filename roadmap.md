# RoadMap

QFS is the token that powers and flows through the QFSwap ecosystem. It allows holders to farm, enter into pools and swap on the exchange among many other things, all at a virtually feeless cost.

The usecases of QFS will be evolving alongside the project with some things already in development.

**At the time of launch you will be able to:**

* Swap QFS in the exchange for other tokens and vice versa.
* Farm QFS with KCS \(KuCoin Token\) to earn more QFS.
* Create a QFS/KCS liquidity pool and earn LP tokens.
* Stake QFS in KuPools and earn more QFS.

**Currently in development:**

* A launchpad where holders of QFS will be able to participate in upcoming IDOs.
* An NFT marketplace where minting and trade will be done using QFS.
* A predictions game where users can bet QFS to win more tokens based on their odds.
* A lottery game where users can enter into a raffle and win a jackpot of QFS tokens.
* A lending platform.
